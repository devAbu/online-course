OOP is a programming language model organized around objects rather than actions, and data rather than logic

OOP concepts:
- objects
- classes
- method & property
- data abstraction & encapsulation
- inheritance
- polymorphism
- constructor / destructor

OOP advantages:
- code reuse & recycling (u istoj app ili drugoj)
- encapsulation
- design benefits
- software maintenance

OOP disadvantages:
- can be complicated to learn
- require extra thinking
- more code

Visibility (properties and methods):
- public --> accessible outside the class
- protected --> accessible in class and any extended class
- private --> accessible only in owner class

<?php
class Example
{
    public $property;
    public function someFunction()
    {
        echo 'code here';
    }
}
?>
